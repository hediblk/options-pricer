# Options Pricer
This is my attempt at implementing the Black-Scholes option pricing model in Python. In the next steps, I plan to add more features such as calculating the Greeks and possibly adding more models to handle American options.
The goal is to then integrate this with a user interface using streamlit for easier interaction and visualization of option pricing scenarios.
